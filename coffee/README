Coupling:
	- Connects shafts of motor GM37-14 and coffee grinder
		http://www.snailshop.cz/zastarale/659-gm37-20.html
	- Three washers should be placed inside the holes. (I used hammer to stuff them in.)
	- With my printer:
		- Grinder side has correct dimensions
		- Motor side hole is too small (6mm is not enough), should be little bit larger (maybe 6.4 in diameter?)

Bracket:
	- With my printer:
		Grinder bracket is too small, it can be stretched using boiling watter

Overall design:
	12V Motor is sometimes still too weak. We should design "smart" control electronics which would measure the current and detect jamming.
	Jamming can be resolved by either using reverse direction for a few seconds or by increasing motor voltage for short period of time.
