Coupling:
	- Connects shafts of motor GM37-20 and coffee grinder
		http://www.snailshop.cz/zastarale/659-gm37-20.html
	- Three washers should be placed inside the holes. (I used hammer to stuff them in.)
	- With my printer:
		- Grinder side has correct dimensions
		- Motor side hole is too small (6mm is not enough), should be little bit larger (maybe 6.4 in diameter?)
